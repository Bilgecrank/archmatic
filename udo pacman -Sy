       Sort the five most recently synchronized mirrors by download speed and overwrite the local mirrorlist:

       Select the 200 most recently synchronized HTTP or HTTPS mirrors, sort them by download speed, and overwrite the file /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist:

              reflector --latest 200 --protocol http,https --sort rate --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

       Select the HTTPS mirrors synchronized within the last 12 hours and located in either France or Germany, sort them by download speed, and overwrite  the  file
       [1m/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist [22mwith the results:

[1mSYSTEMD INTEGRATION[0m
       Reflector  includes  systemd  service and timer units that can be used to automatically update Pacman‚Äôs mirrorlist.  To use the timer, edit the configuration
       file at [1m/etc/xdg/reflector/reflector.conf [22mand then enable the timer with

              systemctl enable reflector.timer
              systemctl start reflector.timer

       Check that status with [1msystemctl list-timers[22m.  To update the mirrorlist immediately instead of waiting for the scheduled operation, run [1msystemctl  start  re‚Äê[0m
       [1mflector.service[22m.
